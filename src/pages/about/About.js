        <p>
          Dedicated my initial professional years to teaching physics, inspiring
          countless students with my passion for unraveling the mysteries of the
          universe. My journey, however, transcended the boundaries of physics,
          leading me into the realm of software development.

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          Fascinated by Science and Technology, I started coding as a hobby,
          crafting simple programs for fun. As my skills grew, so did my
          passion. I explored different languages, tech stacks and projects,
          collaborating with others along the way. Now, having worked as a
          software developer for the last few years, I'm eager to continue to
          learn new tech and making my mark in this dynamic field.
