        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Dedicated my initial professional years to teaching physics, inspiring
          countless students with my passion for unraveling the mysteries of the
          universe. My journey, however, transcended the boundaries of physics,
          leading me into the realm of software development.

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          Fascinated by Science and Technology, I started coding as a hobby,
          crafting simple programs for fun. As my skills grew, so did my
          passion. I explored different languages, tech stacks and projects,
          collaborating with others along the way. Now, as a software developer,
          I'm eager to make my mark in this dynamic field.

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Reflecting on my transformation, my mission is to inspire and empower
          others to embrace curiosity and follow their passions. By bridging the
          gap between physics and software, I aim to demonstrate the power of
          interdisciplinary thinking and encourage future innovators to explore
          the exciting intersections of their interests and expertise.
